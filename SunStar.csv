Aboitiz launches cold storage project for smallholder farmers,"MARCH 17, 2023","IN LINE with its “great transformation” to become the Philippines’ first techglomerate, Aboitiz Group launched Fresh Depot, which seeks to become the first-ever physical and digital solutions platform for farmers in the country.

Its first phase involves piloting a modular and sustainable cold storage unit in Mankayan, Benguet, with the vision of helping farmers reduce their post-harvest losses and maximize crop yield.

“Fresh Depot aims to transform the lives of our farmers by offering a platform that optimizes their yield and income while reducing waste, making a significant contribution to our country’s food security,” said Aboitiz Group President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sabin Aboitiz.

“Uplifting the agricultural sector and our farmers is crucial to

strengthening our food supply chain and reducing our reliance on imports. We see various opportunities to make an impact in this sector and this is just one of the many projects we’re working on,” he added.

According to a study by the Institute of Food Science and Technology of the University of the Philippines Los Baños, about 42 percent of locally grown produce goes bad before it can be eaten, and farmers, consumers, and other supply chain players are suffering for it.

In 2020, the Department of Agriculture (DA) underscored the need to establish more cold storage facilities in the country. This was echoed by the Philippine Chamber of Agriculture and Food Inc. (PCAFI), highlighting that it can reduce post-harvest losses and improve farmers’ income.

In the Philippines, however, most cold storage facilities are located near urban areas and are used for storing meat and other frozen products. These conventional, energy-guzzling cold storages are not built for farmers, who need farm-level and affordable cooling facilities for their crops.

In addition to offering sustainable modular cold storage, Fresh Depot’s second phase will involve digitizing farmers’ land, and planting practices, pre-harvest, harvest, and market information. Digitization will allow Fresh Depot to offer advisory services, explore market linkage opportunities and financial inclusion programs, as well as build a database of information that the government can utilize for their agricultural programs.

This pilot, which will initially run for three to six months, will become a case study for this new type of enterprise, which Aboitiz hopes to scale up across other farm locations in the Philippines if proven viable. Ultimately, Fresh Depot is envisioned to assist the government in enabling millions of farmers.

Among those in attendance during its pilot launch in Mankayan were Benguet Provincial Governor Melchor D. Diclas, Mankayan Mayor Dario Banario, Department of Agriculture-Cordillera Administrative Region Regional Technical Director for Operations Engr. Danilo Daguio, Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal (NVAT) Chairman James P. Estong, NVAT General Manager Gilbert Cumila, EcoZen Solutions President Ravindra Dolare, Hedcor President and COO Rolando Pacquiao, and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Vice President for Transformation Dea Franko Csuba.

Aboitiz is planning to launch a second pilot location in the next few weeks.

Collaborating with local players and global experts

With the support of government units and agencies, Fresh Depot is working with Mankayan’s Manpat-A Farmers Association for its first pilot site of the cold storage unit. The Benguet region is home to quality highland crops and thousands of farmers.

For its pilot project, Fresh Depot is also collaborating with two leading international agri-tech players: Ecozen Solutions Pvt. Ltd., which is backed by Nuveen global impact fund USA and Exim Bank of Government of India; and Cropin Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd., which is backed by Impact Assets Singapore, as one of its investors.

Ecozen manufactured the modular hybrid cold storage unit called Ecofrost. Ecofrost is designed with climate-smart deep tech to harness solar energy to power the unit, with a proprietary technology for battery-less back-up, which after pre-cooling will keep the fresh produce market-ready 24/7.

Meanwhile, Cropin’s services include farm monitoring and management and an easy-to-use, seamless communication solution connecting farmers, agri-businesses, and field officers and helping digitize farm activities. With its presence in 92 countries, the company is known for creating the world’s first industry cloud for agriculture, Cropin Cloud, which helps the agricultural ecosystem make informed decisions that increase farming efficiency, improve productivity, manage risk and environmental changes, and enhance sustainability.

These separate solutions have been tested and proven effective in other parts of the world, such as India, Kenya, and Nigeria. Fresh Depot’s pilot will allow participant farmers to experience how technology has improved agriculture in other developing countries during the period and help future-proof the industry to make it more resilient to emerging threats and challenges.

Moreover, Fresh Depot has been selected by the Basel Agency for Sustainable Energy (Base), a Swiss foundation and Specialized Partner of the United Nations Environment, to participate in a three-month international Incubator Program.

Fresh Depot was selected along with four other global companies that are making decentralized solar-powered cooling accessible to farmers on a pay-per-use basis instead of traditional methods. The Incubator will support Fresh Depot in digitizing inventory management and monitoring the shelf-life of stored crops in real time through an app.

Great transformation in action

Fresh Depot is an innovative solution that has been developed as part of Aboitiz Group's Voyage Program, an internal initiative that aims to discover the most effective solutions to social challenges worldwide.

Other initiatives being developed under the program cover a range of sectors, including food and agriculture, power, infrastructure, education, health, real estate, and manufacturing.

Similar to other business ventures of Aboitiz, the Voyage Program initiatives are aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

Fresh Depot specifically aims to address UN SDGs 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 13 (Climate Action), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). (PR)"

Maraming bagong programa ang ilalabas sa darating na buwan (Our vow in DSWD is to take care of solo parents, not just here in Abra, but in the entire Philippines. There will be new programs that will be implemented in the coming months),” the DSWD Secretary said.

The assistance is in line with the enactment of RA 11861 as amended, which mandates the provision of adequate social protection programs for solo parents from the government.

Gatchalian lauded the province of Abra for having an organized solo parents group, noting the province’s advanced initiatives for the sector.

He said that the DSWD will continue to partner with Abra and other local government units (LGUs) for the provision of assistance to the sector, especially with the implementation of the new law on solo parents.

Abra Governor Dominic Valera hosted the activity and welcomed the DSWD delegation headed by Gatchalian, along with Undersecretary Denise Florence Bragas and DSWD Cordillera Administrative Region (DSWD-CAR) Director Leo Quintilla.

DILG issues guidelines on Cordi LGUs to boost implementation on ‘Bida’ program,"MARCH 10, 2023","THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Cordillera issued guidelines to Cordillera local governments to boost their implementation of the Buhay Ingatan, Droga’y Ayawan (Bida) program to create a lasting impact towards the reduction and proliferation of illegal drugs in communities within the region.

The Bida program implements a two-pronged approach, namely drug supply and demand reduction that works in synergy with community engagement of CSO partners, non-government agencies (NGAs), the local government units (LGUs) and the entire DILG.

“With the strong partnership of the stakeholders in working and advocating the attainment of the objective of the Bida program, we hope to be of great contribution in empowering the communities, enjoining LGUs in anti-illegal drugs activities and raising public awareness of the ill effects of the use of illegal drugs,” said Regional Director Araceli San Jose.

She underscored that the program encourages people to stay away from drugs, and destigmatizing drug dependence and addiction by providing access to recovery and rehabilitation that aims to raise awareness on the ill effects of dangerous drugs through information, education and communication (IEC), promote health and wellness, strengthen institutions in the implementation of drug supply and demand reduction activities and encourage multi-sectoral participation.

“Guided by the Philippine Anti-Illegal Drug Strategy (PADS), this program is the Department’s medium-to long term program, in the national campaign against illegal drugs,” she added.

The BIDA program seeks to improve the quality of life and safeguard the Filipino people from criminality and the ill effects of illegal drugs, in a manner that is within the framework of law and with respect for human rights. It focuses on the pillars of prevention, law enforcement, prosecution and correction, and rehabilitation, wellness, and reintegration.

“We call for the active support of LGUs, law enforcement agencies, civil society and faith-based organizations, NGAs and other stakeholders in advocating for drug supply and demand reduction,” RD San Jose added.

LGUs’ participation

RD San Jose said that the LGUs should be given flexibility as to the execution of the activities such as multisectoral meetings and conferences, declaration of drug-free status for LGUs, seminars, webinars, symposiums, and/or fora on drug prevention, fun runs, bike runs, caravans, sports fests, concerts/ music festivals, presentation of graduates of Community-Based Drug Rehabilitation Program (CBDRP) and recovery wellness programs, showcase of products from rehabilitation facilities and NGA programs and services catered to recovering Persons Who Use Drugs (PWUDs), and their families, inauguration of Special Drug Education Center (SDEC) and rehabilitation centers, implementation of youth-initiated activities and competitions and other similar activities under the banner of Bida.

“The LGUs are in the forefront of this effort and are expected to implement year-round, consistent, and sustained programs, projects, and activities towards the operationalization and institutionalization of the Bida program,” she said.

Adding, “The local chief executives (LCEs) should lead the implementation of the program and mobilize the various departments and offices in the LGUs including those in the Anti-Drug Abuse Council (Adac) and other key stakeholders,” she said.

DILG’s Bida program

Based on the Bidainstitutional framework, the interior sector of DILG should be in charge of supply reduction where the Philippine National Police (PNP) is the primary actor, while the Local Government Sector should be in charge mainly of the demand reduction initiatives where the rehabilitation and reintegration program, as well as drug preventive education and advocacy programs provided by the Department attached agencies, may come in synergy.

In Cordillera, the Department has launched the Bida program on November 28, 2022 where all concerned offices and agencies pledged their commitment to the program implementation.

Panagbenga proof of Baguio resilience from crisis,"FEBRUARY 26, 2023","AFTER a three-year hiatus, the revival of the Panagbenga Festival this year is proving this city's resilience from any calamity, the same reason why it was conceptualized nearly 30 years ago.

""After the killer earthquake in 1990, we thought of a festival that the people of Baguio can participate in and they can own which also aims to bring in tourists for the economy to move again,"" said Mauricio Domogan, Baguio Flower Festival Foundation Inc. lifetime chairperson, on the sidelines of the street dancing parade on Saturday.

The first festival in 1996 was a one-day event. It was later extended to one week, further expanded to two weeks, then a month.

Domogan said the staging of the festival this year is as important as the first, considering their similar objectives -- to make the city rise again and uplift the lives of those affected by the crisis, this time the Covid-19 pandemic.

Domogan, who was mayor at the time the flower festival was born, said “the discussion was what to do to make the city recover, for the city to be visited by the tourists again, an activity that will bring the residents to contribute their time and talent for something that will benefit the whole city"".

Domogan was this city's mayor from 1992 to 2001 and from 2010-2019, and congressman from 2001 to 2010.

“With the brains of the festival, Atty. Damaso Bangaoet, the idea of having something similar to the Pasadena rose parade in California was thought of. I gave the word panagbenga which is our native dialect that simply means a time for blooming,” he said.

Panagbenga formally opens on February 1 of each year.

The last weekend of the month is slated for the institutional grand parades followed by the closure of the city’s main thoroughfare for the “Session in Bloom” when the Session Road is converted into a stretch of selling and activity area until the following Sunday for the closing program and awarding of winners in the different competitions.

“We never thought it will come to this magnitude where hundreds of thousands of people come to Baguio for the whole duration, with most of them arriving for the grand parades,” Domogan said.

He admitted, however, that the number of visitors who joined the street dancing on Saturday did not breach the pre-pandemic level.

“Our having the festival this year shows our resiliency in any calamity. That despite the challenges, we stand up to show that we will be okay,” Domogan said.

Baguio City had 1.7 million tourist arrivals from January to October 2022, surpassing the 2019 record of 1.2 million visitors.

The festival partially resumed last year sans crowd-drawing activities like the flower-themed floats due to health protocols, luring 45,000 visitors on its final weekend.

Inspiring tradition, culture

Meanwhile, the street dancing competition, one of the festival highlights, once again showed the rich culture, diverse beliefs and colorful traditions of the Cordillerans.

Among the traditions presented was the cañao, a socio-religious ritual where chickens, pigs and/or carabaos are butchered and feasted on as a thanksgiving to their god, Kabunian.

Ikoshin Miguel, whose group performed a dance number depicting the cañao, explained its importance.

“The legend of cañao, o yung pinakaunang rason kung bakit nagkaroon ang Cordillera ng mga cañao na ginagawa bilang tradisyon kahit man may nangyaring masama o may magandang nangyari, positive or negative. Ito kasi is parang ‘yun ‘yung way naming para mag-pray kay Kabunian (This is the story of how cañao started in the Cordillera as part of its tradition, whether its good or bad. This is our way of praying to Kabunian),” she said.

The last part of their performance, Miguel said, showed the weaving tradition of the six provinces of Cordillera.

She added that in performing for the Panagbenga, they want to show other young people from the province that the art of dancing may also be used as an instrument in showing the richness of their culture.

Two other participants, Lovely May Pesiglagan and Henessy Mang-er from Sagada, Mountain Province, expressed pride in their performance, depicting their belief in mythical creatures, which, they said, is a first for the Panagbenga Festival.

“Our performance is about mythical creatures kung saan sa ilog, tradisyon kasi sa amin na magbato muna ng bato sa water before mag-fetch or mag swimming, we’re going to wait 10 minutes para umalis yung mga anito na tinatawag (where it has been our tradition to throw a stone into the river water before we fetch or swim, then wait for about 10 minutes for the unseen creatures to go away),” Pesiglagan said.

Mang-Er said the first concept they thought of was also Kabunian, but they changed their mind since it is a common theme in Panagbenga performances.

Visitors who went to Baguio to witness the Panagbenga events were left in awe of the street dancing parade performers.

Rolan Afilo, who is vacationing from Dubai, said his family purposely went to this city to experience the Panagbenga.

""Very colorful at tsaka yung effort nila amazing. Hindi matatawaran, so we just said that it's like we're in Brazil. Ang preparation spectacular and I can say na pinaghandaan ng mga tao dito (their effort is amazing. I say that residents have really prepared for this event),"" he said.

The dance groups, mainly composed of young people, said performing their cultural traditions through dances is their way of showing that they love their province and their roots.

EJ Justin Balao and Lea Dodon expressed pride in being Cordillerans.

“Napakasaya namin kasi dati nagka-pandemic, wala ‘yung mga ganitong competition na nasasalihan naming to express our talent. Tsaka mahal namin ang kultura namin (We are so happy because when the pandemic hit the country, the events and competitions stopped so we do not have a venue to show our talents. And also, we love our culture),” Balao said. (PNA)"
"'Bigger, better' Panagbenga to return after 2-year hiatus","DECEMBER 12, 2022","BAGUIO CITY – The Baguio Flower Festival Foundation (BFFF) and the city government launched on Monday the Panagbenga (Blooming) Festival, promising the return of ""bigger and better"" events next year.

""We will astound the world with one of the finest presentations that showcase our creativity and the very best cultural heritage,"" Mayor Benjamin Magalong said during the launch.

The festival, which started as a Baguio community event in 1995, was scrapped in 2020 while celebrations in the succeeding years were toned down due to the pandemic.

""Let Panagbenga flourish again and again as a well-spring of hope and a sense of community pride. We will again offer the richness of our tradition, the beauty of our environment, wealth and hospitality of Baguio people that can be readily offered,"" he added.

Former mayor Mauricio Domogan, lifetime chairman of the BFFF, advised the executive committee to invite festival competition winners in other provinces in the country to be part of the 2023 festival, which is a rebound of the canceled 25th year of Panagbenga in 2021.

""We hope to have them join us as contingents in the parades,"" Domogan said.

Anthony de Leon, chairman of the executive committee (Execom) also said ""the 2023 Panagbenga will be grander with all activities to be made bigger and better.""

In a statement, DOLE Ilocos regional director lawyer Evelyn Ramos said various programs and projects are now rolled out to address the concerns of workers, as well as employers, which arose due to the natural calamity two weeks ago.

“The DOLE Ilocos regional office is set to award livelihood starter kits to 157 skills trainees through a partnership with Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The starter kits worth PHP30,000 under the DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program aim to launch self-employment among TESDA NC II training graduates with their newly-acquired skills in carpentry, masonry, or electrical installation,” she said.

Various livelihood projects are also awarded to beneficiaries from Aguilar, Dagupan City, Calasiao, and Sta. Barbara in Pangasinan with a total disbursement of PHP1.8 million.

“The livelihood projects benefited farmers, persons with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer members, and displaced transport workers,” she added.

The DOLE also resumed the distribution of financial assistance to displaced OFWs through the Abot Kamay ang Pagtulong (AKAP) wherein some 4,752 OFWs are set to receive their aid of PHP10,000 each, with the total amount of PHP47.5 million ready for disbursement. (PNA)"

"Baguio tags 5,000 pine trees being preserved at Busol watershed","JUNE 21, 2022","BAGUIO CITY – The city government has already identified and tagged 5,000 pine trees at the Busol watershed as part of its protection and conservation plans in one of the country's remaining forest reserves.

City Planning and Development officer Donna Tabangin on Tuesday said the inventory will be a major component of the ongoing preparation of the Busol Forest Management Plan, the updating of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and the Urban Regreening Program

“The city must include [the inventory in] its thrust to revitalize the environment and arrest urban decay,” she said.

The official said the activity started in April and is expected to be completed this June.

“To assure proper identification, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Watershed and Water Resources Research Development and Extension Center assisted the personnel to acquire skills on the proper tagging to avoid hurting the trees,” she said.

Tabangin said that for the trees' protection, the teams use water-based white latex paint on the lightly scraped surface of the tree trunks.

The inventory, tagging, and identification of the trees were spearheaded by the City Environment and Parks Management Office and barangays Ambiong, Brookspoint, East Bayan Park, and Pacdal that straddle the watershed’s area.

Public Information Office chief Aileen Refuerzo said in a separate interview that the Busol Forest Reserve is the largest potable water source in the city, making it one of the centerpieces of the city's environmental preservation programs.

The city also has the Eco-walk project, in which schools ""adopt"" certain areas of the reservation for their tree planting and management activities, allowing school children to experience being inside the forest and planting a tree. The Eco-walk project gave the city a UNESCO recognition in the mid-1990s.

“We tell them, water does not come from your faucets, it comes from the forest like Busol that is why there is a need to preserve and plant trees, and to protect the watershed,” Refuerzo said. (PNA)"
"Independence Day job fair in Baguio to offer over 1,000 jobs","JUNE 07, 2022","BAGUIO CITY – The city government on Monday invited job seekers to its Independence Day job fair on June 12 where over 1,200 vacancies will be offered.

In an interview on Monday, Doy Tabilog, executive assistant at the Mayor’s Office and in charge of the Public Employment and Services Office (PESO), said that as of Friday, at least 20 local companies and five overseas manpower agencies have registered to be part of the job fair at the Bishop Carlito Cenzon open gymnasium at the Saint Louis University compound.

He said other service providers like the National Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and Social Security System will join the event so applicants could easily secure the required documents for their application.

The job fair will be done face-to-face and will include local and overseas employment opportunities.

Tabilog said the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and the Department of Trade and Industry will also participate by providing services and information about skills and scholarship, aside from livelihood assistance and opportunities.

Prospective applicants may pre-register until June 11 at the People's Park. They can also preregister at the Department of Labor and Employment Baguio-Benguet Field Office in Cabinet Hill, the PESO at the Baguio City Hall, and the Barangay Employment Service Office (Baguio City).

Tabilog said the city government regularly conducts job and livelihood fairs not only to provide job opportunities to residents but also to keep them away from illegal activities.

“Being unemployed and without an income to provide for the family’s needs is difficult that is why we want our people to have a source of income so that they will not be prompted to go into illegal activities that will lead to self-harm or danger to their families,” he said.

He said some do know where to look for job vacancies which is why job fairs are a good activity to bring the services of the government closer to the people.

Tabilog also said that clients can also be referred to the other agencies present during the fair for possible livelihood opportunities like upskilling or reskilling for higher chances of employment or income-generating activities.

The official also said that job seekers can rest assured that the participating companies and manpower agencies are legitimate. (PNA)"
Cagayan farmers celebrate increased yellow corn yield thru harvest festival,"MAY 23, 2022","LAUNCHED in October 2021, the yellow corn project is a six-month inclusive business pilot project by Cargill Philippines and Save the Children Philippines that provides training on good agricultural practices, farming inputs, post-harvest support, and integration of farmers directly into the animal feed value chain.

Since then, 430 farmer families have benefitted from the project and showcased a higher-level of agricultural process and improved livelihood together with their school children.

Francis Samilin, a farmer beneficiary partner, said the trainings they received through the yellow corn project improved their knowledge and skills in corn farming.

“The quality of the produced corn is good. The volume of our harvest increased and our income increased. If this continues, this will help us improve our status in life and the welfare of our children, especially the younger ones, for their education,” said Samilin.

Highlights of the event included the unveiling of a visibility marker of the flatbed dryer that was repaired through the project and the official announcement of Sto. Domingo Multi-Purpose Cooperative as an accredited supplier of yellow corn to Cargill.

Since March 30, Sto. Domingo Multi-Purpose Cooperative delivered almost 314,000 kilos of corn to Cargill.

Monico Castro, chief of Field Operations Division of DA Region Field Unit 2, expressed gratitude to Cargill for helping the corn industry in the Cagayan Valley -- dubbed as the Corn Capital of the Philippines -- and transforming Philippine agriculture.

“We are very thankful to Cargill for this initiative, because given that resources are scarce, we need convergence. We need collaboration so we can implement programs in accordance with the One DA Framework: Consolidation, Modernization, Industrialization, and Professionalization,” said Castro.

The Yellow Corn project is aligned to the One DA Framework and the National Corn Program. This inclusive business project with small-holder corn farmers is the official contribution of Cargill to the Task Force Pilipinas Kontra Gutom (PKG), a multi-sectoral movement led by the private sector established to help eradicate hunger and malnutrition in the Philippines by 2030.

Cargill Philippines and Save the Children Philippines are active members of the PKG Workstream 1 – Availability and Accessibility. This project has been recognized both by the DA and PKG for its contributions in improving the productivity and lives of small-holder farmers.

Cargill Philippines hopes to replicate this program on a wider scale with more corn cooperatives in the Cagayan Valley region and even beyond.

“Empowering local farmers is key to building resilience in farming communities, as well as addressing food security challenges. Building upon the success of the Yellow Corn Project, Cargill hopes to find more value-creating opportunities for smallholder farmers as we nourish the world safely and sustainably,” said Sonny Catacutan, president of Cargill Philippines and Managing Director of Cargill Animal Nutrition and Health Philippines.

"1,700 fisherfolk march on Earth Day to stop dredging for black sand mining in Aparri","APRIL 22, 2022","ONE thousand seven hundred fisherfolk from more than 12 barangays in Aparri marched on Friday, Earth Day, to protest black sand mining operations in the town, which they say is happening in the guise of river dredging.

This was the first time that a protest of this magnitude was organized in the town.

The fisherfolk were joined by other groups from neighboring towns of Gattaran, Ballesteros, Buguey, Gonzaga, and Sta. Ana.

A prayer service and program were held at the San Pedro Telmo Parish Church where fisherfolk shared the effects of the alleged mining operations to their livelihood and environment.

Mayoralty candidates for the 2022 elections, incumbent mayor Bryan Dale Chan, and long-time former mayor Dr. Ismael Tumaru, were in attendance to respond to their problems.

Fisherfolk report that the supposed river dredging activities produce sound, light, and chemical pollution that have gravely disturbed the ecosystem, messed with reproductive patterns of aquatic resources, decimated the fish and shrimp population, including that of the aramang or spider shrimp, which is endemic in the area.

The dwindling catch has considerably slashed the income of 11,000 fisherfolk and their families. Before the river dredging operations started in the first quarter of 2021, fisherfolk said one boat could catch up to 200 kilos of fish overnight off the coast of Aparri. Now, they would be lucky to take home three kilos of fish. They also shared that from December 2021 to April 2022, each fisherman would earn 300 to 1,000 pesos for three days’ work, a far cry from their 3,000 to 7,000 peso earnings before that period.

Aparri fisherfolk and residents reported the return of mining activity in the first quarter of 2021 with dredging seacrafts and huge sea carriers of the Chinese firm Riverfront Construction Inc. visibly operating in the Cagayan River, the Aparri delta, and the West Philippine Sea.

The Cagayan Provincial government headed by Governor Manuel N. Mamba explained that the presence of large ships is due to the ongoing large-scale dredging to desilt the Cagayan river, not only as a river rehabilitation and flood control project, but also as a necessary “enabling activity for the reopening of the Aparri port and the establishment of an international seaport.”

The project, entitled the Cagayan River Restoration Project, is headed by the Department of Environment and Natural Environment with Mamba as the convenor of an inter-agency committee that includes the Department of Public Works and Highways, Department of Transportation, and the Department of Interior and Local Government.

Mamba has also said he will resign if the people can prove there were indeed mining activities there.

But local fishermen attest that the vessels suck sand at the open sea, right at the areas where they fish, which are several kilometers from the mouth of the river, way beyond the designated dredging segments. Marine traffic tracking reveal back and forth trips of the vessels from Northern Philippines to China which, fisherfolk believe, is the end destination of the mined magnetite from the black sand. For example, Hong Chang, a bulk carrier that can haul up to 64,000 metric tons of sand material has done trips between Aparri to China at least four times since the dredging project started.

Fisherfolk and many Aparri residents also insist that the river dredging project actually brings the threat of erosion to an area that is already perennially inundated by floods brought about by strong rains and typhoons. As a flood-control project, it defeats its purpose, they said.

Mayor Chan speaking at the Earth Day program shared the RCI does not have a permit to dredge the river, but only a general engineering permit.

He also said that the project went into full swing without public hearings and proper consultation with the people. Chan reiterated his support to the fisherfolk in their fight to stop black sand mining.

Addressing government leaders, dried fish vendor Marlyne Bugarin cried, “We plead for your compassion. Our fervent hope is that disaster brought about by black sand mining be stopped. May the Lord touch your hearts so that you will feel and see our call.”

Parish priest Fr. Manuel Catral said the Earth Day event dubbed “Alay Lakad Para sa Kabuhayan, Kalikasan, Kinabukasan” was intended to be a platform for the fisherfolk to express their depressing situation to the people of Aparri and its future leaders.

“Fishing is the lifeblood of Aparri. Its people’s identities are closely anchored in its waters. The Parish of San Pedro Telmo is united with the fisherfolk in their clamor to stop ecological plunder of the river and the seas and claim their economic, social, and cultural rights,” Catral said.

Baguio nears month sans Covid-19 deaths,"APRIL 19, 2022","BAGUIO CITY – The local government here said the city is on its 27th day without any person dying of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

The city’s Public Information Office chief Aileen Refuerzo said on Monday the statistics are based on the daily report of the city's Health Services Office (HSO).

“Zero deaths in Baguio City in the last 27 days”, the post on the city’s PIO social media page said on Monday morning.

The HSO report released on April 17 shows that Baguio has four active Covid-19 cases after the addition of one new case on the same day.

Records also show that the city has logged a total of 830 deaths and 41,447 total cases since the start of the pandemic in 2020.

Earlier, Dr. Rowena Galpo, chief health officer of the city government, said the low number of cases and fatalities is seen as a result of the high vaccination rate in Baguio.

As of April 13, the city’s Covid-19 vaccination record shows that 281,125 individuals have received the full dose, breaching the 281,000 target population. Meanwhile, 112,096 have received a booster dose.

No spike in Covid-19 cases despite Panagbenga: Baguio CHO,"APRIL 06, 2022","BAGUIO CITY – Local health officials are not seeing any signs of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases going up even after the Baguio Flower Festival or Panagbenga 2022 attracted thousands of tourists to the country's summer capital.

City health officer Dr. Rowena Galpo, in an interview on Tuesday, admitted that the city had expected an increase in cases when it eased restrictions in the city and when it held its famous three-week festival. However, the complete opposite seemed to have happened.

“Our vaccination rate is high and the residents are still observing the minimum public health protocols – like distancing, wearing of face mask, washing of hands, ventilation in buildings.”

She said these were the factors that contributed to the low number of cases being logged in the city despite it holding its famous three-week festival.

“Noong medyo nag-ease na tayo ng restriction, we expected na by end of February, tataas [kasi] open na tayo, nag Panagbenga tayo na nag start noon during the first week of March, the second week, the third week of March. April na tayo and we have not seen any indication of increases (When we eased our restrictions, we expected an increase in the cases by the end of February. We did the Panagbenga on the first week, the second week, the third week of March. And it is now April, we have not seen any indication of an increase in cases),” she said.

As of 6 p.m. on April 4, the city's Public Information Office posted that the city has seven active cases with an additional one case recorded on the same day. The city has recorded a total of 41,441 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic in 2020.

She said that a number of residents contracting the virus since the start of the pandemic could have added to the immunity of the people, aside from a good number of them receiving the vaccine.

“Iyong kadami ng cases natin, nagkaroon na tayo ng immunity by vaccination and by having the disease which is a natural immunity. So iyon siguro ang factors. We will continue to give the vaccine,” the doctor said.

The local government earlier said the city's mega vaccination facilities will already be shut down, though vaccination at rural health units in 128 villages in Baguio and private drugstores in the central business district will continue.

As of April 4, the city government has given the first dose of the vaccine to 293,637 people; the second dose to 280,416 people, and a booster shot to 106,829 people.

Baguio is targeting to inoculate 281,000 of its adult population against Covid-19, out of the city's 366,000 total residents, based on the survey by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in 2020.

Meanwhile, some 34,470 members of the pediatric population belonging to the 12 to 17-year-old age group or 85.67 percent of the 40,238 targets have been fully vaccinated.

Among children aged 5 to 11 years old, 8,250 have been fully vaccinated out of the 46,955 eligible population.

Galpo said they still do the mobile vaccination and get the help of the barangay health workers and nutrition scholars, including officials of the barangays, in convincing those who have not received the full dose or the booster shots to be vaccinated for their protection.

“We are still doing house-to-house convincing them to get the booster shot and the vaccine for those who have not been jabbed,” she said, adding that the city targets to get a 100-percent booster vaccination rate to help the country attain a total herd immunity. (PNA)"
Panagbenga weekend draws 45K tourists amid pandemic,"MARCH 30, 2022","BAGUIO CITY – Amid a global pandemic, the Baguio Flower Festival or Panagbenga 2022 still managed to attract 45,000 tourists during its last weekend alone, much to the delight of the city government.

The city government is happy with the result of the Panagbenga 2022 or the Baguio Flower Festival that opened on March 6 and ended on the 27th which boosted the business climate in the city.

Mayor Benjamin Magalong, in a recorded interview shared by the Public Information Office to the media on Tuesday, estimated up to 22,000 visitors arrived everyday since March 25. ""Mga 40,000 to 45,000 last weekend na visitors so talagang marami (We had about 40,000 to 45,000 visitors over the weekend),” he said

“Very good [ang] business climate especially na andoon pa ang Session Road event natin (the Session road event was still there),” the mayor added.

He said they saw the bulk of tourists who arrived on March 26 triggering traffic congestion in the city's main thoroughfares.

To address traffic congestion, the mayor said they had to ask the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to temporarily remove the barricades on roads that were still deemed under construction but could already be used.

The mayor mentioned that despite the cancellation of the major crowd-drawing events like the grand street dancing and the flower float parades, the Panagbenga weekend arrivals showed the tourists' desire to be part of the annual festival of the city.

With the end of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in sight, he said the 2023 Panagbenga is expected to be even bigger.

The flower festival's major events were all canceled in 2020, with only very minor events that did not draw a big crowd being retained. The following year’s celebration was as simple.

This year’s festival, while simpler than the pre-pandemic celebrations, became a sought-after event with the arrival of thousands of tourists that also gave a boost to the local economy which was greatly affected by the pandemic. (PNA)"

In a public advisory, Jenny Afroilan, principal specialist of NGCP said the affected areas cover this city and the towns of Burgos, Piddig, Dingras, and Marcos from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

“The reason for the power interruption is due to the annual preventive maintenance and testing and corrective activities of equipment at the Laoag substation,” said Afroilan.

As frequently observed, many residents here tend to go out of their homes during a power outage to avoid heat and boredom.

Some of them are spotted on the province’s public beaches or in river resorts especially since the country’s dry season has already started.

World-renowned Palaui Island reopens after 2 years,"MARCH 09, 2022","TUGUEGARAO CITY – The world-famous Palaui Island in Cagayan province is open again to tourists starting Tuesday after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic.

At the height of the health crisis in 2020, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) provided PHP1 million to fund the emergency employment of about 160 families in the island.

Officials of the DENR, Department of Tourism, Cagayan Economic Zone Authority, local government, and other members of the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) led the ribbon-cutting ceremony to signal the reopening of the 8,048-hectare Palaui Island Protected Landscape and Seascape (PIPLS) in Barangay San Vicente, Santa Ana, according to a Facebook post.

The PAMB is the decision-making body of the PIPLS, a protected area legislated by virtue of Republic Act 11038, or the expanded protected areas system law.

DENR Region 2 Executive Director, Gwendolyn Bambalan, said the reopening of the PIPLS will boost the economy and will help the country recover from the effects of the public health emergency.

""Last year, our department initiated the improvement of facilities in PIPLS with a budget of PHP4.7 million,"" she said. ""With the influx of tourists, there should be an office dedicated to manage our environment and natural resources here.”

Two accredited boat operators’ associations, the San Vicente Motor Banca Association and Palaui San Vicente Motor Banca Association have been ferrying tourists.

The island covers 8,048 hectares with 1,008-hectare coral reefs, 472-hectare seagrasses and 102-hectare mangrove.

It became famous for hosting two seasons of the reality show “Survivor USA” and for being included in the top 10 most beautiful beaches of the world by CNN, an international broadcast network.

In 2019, the marine protected area (MPA) was awarded outstanding National Integrated Protected Area System-Marine Protected Area by the Para El Mar: MPA Awards and Recognition, a biennial event that showcases the country's best performing MPAs.

Bacolod City eyes requiring negative swab test for government Apors,"JANUARY 11, 2022","THE Bacolod City Emergency Operations Center Task Force (EOC-TF) has asked Mayor Evelio Leonardia to request the National Inter-Agency Task Force (NIATF) to also require government authorized persons outside of residence (Apors) bound for the city to present negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result regardless of their vaccination status.

Councilor Renecito Novero, chairman of the city’s quarantine center action team, said Monday, January 10, that government Apors should also present negative RT-PCR test results amid the surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases.

Due to the continued spread of the Omicron variant of Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19, the City Government earlier required all travelers bound for Bacolod City to present a negative RT-PCR test result effective January 9, 2022.

In an executive order (EO) issued by Mayor Evelio Leonardia, such a requirement covers travelers coming from areas classified under Alert Level 3 in terms of Covid-19 transmission whether they are vaccinated or not.

The RT-PCR test should be taken within 72 hours prior to and upon arrival in Bacolod City.

Aside from the negative RT-PCR test, travelers are still required to present BaCTrac registration, Safe, Swift and Smart Passage (S-Pass), vaccination card and identification cards.

The EO stated that all government officials or public sector personnel on official business shall be allowed unimpeded travel into Bacolod City from any area regardless of the alert level status, provided that they comply with the vaccination mandate under NIATF Resolution No. 148-B, Series of 2021, dated November 11, 2021.

They must also present a valid ID issued by their respective government agencies; vaccination card/ID showing when they were fully vaccinated and/or have undergone a booster dose.

“Those who are only partially vaccinated or are still unvaccinated shall present their negative RT-PCR test result,” it added.

Among other requirements for government officials and workers included presentation of an original/certified true copy of their travel order/authority issued by the head of their agency or by his/her authorized superior; symptom screening at the airport or seaport upon arrival; and strict compliance with existing minimum public health standards.

Novero, however, said government Apors should also be included because they might also be carriers of the virus.

“We recorded a double-digit of Covid-19 cases, so it’s better to prevent than cure,” he said.

The official said he is planning to pass a resolution on Wednesday’s regular session to implement this measure.

Novero noted that this plan was discussed during their huddle meeting on Sunday, January 9, along with the members of the EOC-TF.

Meanwhile, Novero said he will also ask Leonardia to renew the contract of services of the healthcare workers including the doctors, nurses and contact tracers who were earlier hired by the city.

He said their contract of services expired on December 31, 2021.

“We need to renew their contract of services because we have a surge of Covid-19 cases. We should be ready for any eventuality,” he added."

The fireworks display will start at 9 p.m. until midnight.

Cordillera farmers benefit from P556-M agri assistance,"NOVEMBER 05, 2021","RICE and vegetable farmers in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) who have been affected by the recent typhoon received interventions amounting to P556,345,158 funded by the government through the Department of Agriculture (DA).

Agriculture Secretary William Dar led the OneDA family in the awarding of assistance during the launch of the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund-Rice Farmers Financial Assistance (RCEF-RFFA) Program in Baguio City on October 28, 2021.

“The Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) is one of the best reforms that have happened today. The bottom line of RTL that also provides RCEF is to make the rice farmers very competitive para puwede tayong makipagtunggali sa rice farmers sa iba’t ibang bansa,” Dar said, adding that the cost of palay production will be at the level of P7 per kilogram at the end of the six-year implementation period.

Through the RFFA, rice farmers enrolled in the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) with landholdings of two hectares and below will receive unconditional cash assistance worth P5,000.

The program will benefit 65,836 Cordillera rice farmers with a total cash assistance amounting to P329.18 million.

In partnership with the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and SquidPay Technology Inc., the DA-CAR Field Office will start distributing to the beneficiaries the Interventions Monitoring Card (IMC) that serves as an identification card and cash card.

Dar also mentioned other salient interventions that must be further funded and supported to make local farmers more competitive, such as drying facilities and other post-harvest facilities, use of biofertilizers and biopesticides, and mass labeling of vegetables and fruits for food safety.

“Let’s make our vegetable production more efficient. Let’s lessen the cost of producing a kilo of any vegetables. That’s the only way for the long term we can be competitive with the rest of the world,” he said.

On the issue of smuggled vegetables, the agri chief said that last October, the DA, in cooperation with the Bureau of Customs, confiscated almost half a million pesos worth of vegetables and fruits.

“Gumagalaw po ang inyong gobyerno, hindi po kami natutulog. Let’s help one another. Yes, you should be a part in really identifying those illegal shippers,” he added.

During the event, Dar also awarded check and cash assistance for the calamity-affected farmers and fisherfolk in the region.

The DA-Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) approved a credit fund amounting to P10 million for the Lengaoan Indigenous Farmers Multi-Purpose Cooperative as lending conduit under the Expanded Sure Aid and Recovery Project. Small farmers and fishers may avail themselves of P20,000 interest-free loans without collateral and payable for 10 years through the Sure Program.

Additional assistance amounting to P135 million from the Quick Response Fund has been allotted for the region’s rehabilitation and recovery program to benefit the farmers and fisherfolk severely affected by Habagat and Typhoon Maring.

Polyethylene plastic sheets and various vegetable seeds worth P1,285,750 were also distributed as initial assistance under the region’s recovery program.

“Hindi po nagpapabaya ang gobyerno na tumutulong at nakahandang sumuporta sa lahat ng mga magsasaka at mangingisda,” Dar said.

The Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC), meanwhile, paid P3,165,821 for the indemnity and claims for rice, corn, high-value crops, livestock, and credit and life term insurance.

Other interventions awarded during Dar’s visit in CAR were: 50 units of aquaponics system worth P2.75 million from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), eight hauling trucks and two refrigerated vans amounting to P21.44 million from the banner programs of DA-CAR, and P22 million worth truck-mounted water well drilling rig and support equipment.

Dar highlighted the importance of collective action and urged farmers to join cooperatives that are active both in the production and marketing of commodities and eventually in value-adding activities.

He stressed that farm clustering and cooperative development are important for higher efficiencies in operations and improved profits.

The Modernized Greenhouse with Hydroponics Project worth P950,000, four units twin tunnel greenhouse for strawberry enterprise worth P950,000, and P7,879,263 worth farm-to-market road were also turned over for the farmers in Tuba, Benguet, and Sto. Tomas, Baguio City.

“We have to plan and invest early in this protective and precision agriculture that is the way forward to continuously produce vegetables,” Dar said.

He emphasized the importance of modern and climate-resilient agriculture infrastructure both in rural and urban areas for the unhampered production of enough vegetables.

He also inaugurated the research and development facilities of the DA-CAR Technology Resource Hub amounting to P9,738,672 for the food processing facility and P12,005,650 for the plant genetic resources center funded by the Bureau of Agricultural Research. (PR)"
Cagayanos receive P199.5M worth of machines,"NOVEMBER 05, 2021","RICE farmers in Cagayan province received a total of P199.5 million worth of machinery grant under the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund Mechanization Program during the turnover ceremony held on November 4 in Iguig, Cagayan.

Around 17,427 members who belong to 112 qualified farmers’ cooperatives and associations (FCAs) are expected to benefit from the machinery grant.

Dr. Baldwin G. Jallorina, PHilMech director, graced the ceremony and encouraged the farmers to take good care of the machines. He promised them additional grants should they be good stewards.

“Sana magamit ninyo ng husto ang makinarya, pagyamanin at magamit ng mahabang panahon. At kung mataas ang utilization rate, ang challenge ko sa inyo, madadagdagan po natin yan ng postharvest facilities upang makumpleto ang mga makinarya,” Jallorina said.

“Sana ang mga ibibigay sa inyong mga makinarya ay mas lalong palakasin ang inyong samahan at hindi maging simula ng inyong hindi pagkakaunawaan,” he added.

Meanwhile, Narciso Edillo, Department of Agriculture (DA)-Cagayan executive director, challenged the farmers to also manage the machinery well for the next generation.

“Bagamat grant ito, hindi ibig sabihin ay basta basta na lang ang paggamit natin. Alagaan po natin ang mga ito upang pakinabangan pa ng mga anak at apo natin sa ating mga associations,” Edillo said.

These machines were funded under 2021 funds and the 2019 and 2020 excess funds from competitive biddings.

About 28 municipalities and one city will be covered under this batch of distributions. These areas include Alcala, Aparri, Baggao, Buguey, Gattaran, Gonzaga, Camalaniugan, Lal-Lo, Sta Ana, Sta Teresita, Abulug, Allacapan, Ballesteros, Lasam, Pamplona, Claveria, Piat, Sanchez Mira, Sto.

Local government officials and provincial and municipal agriculturists also graced the ceremony. They all expressed their gratitude for the grants received under the program. (PR)"
Cops build restroom for sitio in Benguet,"NOVEMBER 01, 2021","WITH the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic highlighting the importance of personal hygiene, Benguet policemen built a public restroom for a small community in Tublay, Benguet.

Personnel from the 2nd Benguet Provincial Mobile Force Company constructed the restroom for the residents of Sitio Bongog in Barangay Basil while building a house for a beneficiary of their “Pabahay Handog” project.

The expenses for the restroom were sourced from contributions of the police personnel, as well as from the donations of other individuals and stakeholders.

The construction of the public restroom is expected to benefit more or less 70 residents of the sitio.

After more than a month of construction, the restroom was formally turned over to the residents last October 22.

Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar commended the PNP personnel for their initiative to better serve the small community in Sitio Bongog.

“Isa sa pangunahing pangangailangan ang pagkakaroon ng maayos at malinis na palikuran. Saludo ako sa mga pulis ng Benguet na naisipang magtayo ng public restroom para sa kanilang mga kababayan,” Eleazar said.

“Sama-sama tayong magtulungan upang maitaguyod ang pangangailangan sa bawat komunidad,” he added. (PR)"
Sagada cancels annual Nov. 1 'Panag-apoy',"OCTOBER 28, 2021","BAGUIO CITY – The usual observance of All Saints Day in Sagada, Mountain Province where the town appears to be ""on flame"" will not happen again this year after the local government unit (LGU) ordered cemeteries to be closed on November 1.

""We will not have the usual observance of November 1 where residents light a ""saleng"" (pine twig) together at the cemetery in the afternoon,"" Mayor James Pooten said.

Pooten, in a phone interview with the Philippine News Agency on Wednesday, said the municipal Inter-Agency Task Force (MIATF) adhered to the order of the national IATF to close all cemeteries nationwide to the public from October 29 to November 3.

""Because there will be nobody at the cemetery on November 1, we will not see 'saleng' lighted beside the tombs of the loved ones,"" he said.

He said they have already issued an order giving schedules to residents in the different villages for their visit to cemeteries from October 25 to 29 and will only open to villagers on November 3.

Residents from other areas with relatives in Sagada cemeteries can visit from November 3 onwards, the mayor said.

He said the ""panag-apoy"" (lighting of fire) is a practice among residents as a way to remember their dead loved ones.

It is similar to others where they light a candle, ""but in our case, we light a pine twig which emits the smell of a pine tree resin and it produces a bigger fire compared to a candle,"" Pooten said.

The ""saleng"" used to be the community's source of light in the olden times due to the absence of electricity, and is still practiced up to this day by residents as a source of light in place of candles.

As a native of Sagada, the mayor said he grew up with such practice during the afternoon of November 1.

""I am now 58, it is how we do it on that day,"" he said.

Pooten also clarified that ""panag-apoy"" is not a festival, but the locals' observance of All Saints Day. (PNA)"
"Nas Academy reconciles with Apo Whang-Od, Kalinga community","OCTOBER 24, 2021","TINGLAYAN, Kalinga -- Global online learning platform Nas Academy visited Maria Oggay, also known as Apo Whang-od, and the Butbut Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs) in Barangay Buscalan, Municipality of Tinglayan, Kalinga to formalize their reconciliation.

The customary process was arranged by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) after dialogues with Nas Academy.

“The NCIP, through the Office on Education, Culture and Health (OECH) and the Office of Empowerment and Human Rights (OEHR) is mandated to ensure that the rights to cultural integrity of our ICCs/IPs are recognized, respected, promoted, and protected. After meeting with the Nas Academy team and hearing their side, it was decided to finally put this issue to rest by using the customary laws and practices on conflict resolution, healing, and reconciliation. The meeting took place in the community in Buscalan and was attended by all parties including Apo Whang-od, her family, IP Elders and community members, as well as representatives from the NCIP, House of Representatives and Nas Academy,” Nas said in a statement.

""We went to the Kalinga community to humbly pay our respects to Apo Whang-Od, her family, and the entire community. We are honored to meet with all the chiefs of the five communities of the Butbut tribe leaders of the different barangays, including Buscalan Village Chief Leon Baydon through the help of NCIP. We had an open discussion in front of the whole community to understand one another, came to a resolution and then decided on how to move forward. We are grateful to NCIP for organizing and joining us in this gathering as well as the chairperson of the House of Representatives' Committee on Indigenous Cultural Communities and Indigenous Peoples for joining us in the trip,"" added Jacqueline Maye Lim, Nas Academy head of Philippine Operations, who led her team.

The event ended with the partaking of the shared meal as a sign of healing and reconciliation according to the customs and tradition of the Butbut ICCs/IPs.

The community, through their elders thanked Nas Academy for their sincere apology and reiterated that they must follow the procedures since the art of tattooing is not solely practiced by Apo Whang-Od or the Butbut ICCs/IPs, but is also shared across the multiple ICCs/IPs in Kalinga province.

During the community meeting, Chairperson Allen Capuyan emphasized the importance of using the customary laws and practices in resolving conflict, which is restorative and not punitive, thereby attaining healing and reconciliation.

Kalinga Representative Allen Jesse Mangaoang further conveyed the request of the tribal elders that the contract previously signed by Apo Whang-od with Nas Academy be declared null and void, and this was later affirmed by Nas Academy Legal Team.

Nas Academy Country Head Josabeth ""Joji"" Alonso, who is also the lead legal counsel for the Philippines, said: ""The Philippines is very close to Nas Academy's heart, and they will always strive for truth and fairness in all their endeavors. As educators, they intend to teach by example and this initiative, which is anchored on humility and respect, is by far one of the best values they can demonstrate and teach their students.""

""Nas Academy has always been a fan of the Philippines and will always continue to be. Now that everything is behind us, I am excited for how Nas Academy will transform the way millions people learn in the Philippines and outside of it,"" said Nuseir Yassin, CEO and founder of Nas Academy.

Nas Academy aspires to build a community of Filipino educators and learners by offering courses on personal development, small business empowerment, and content creation on their platform.

Nas Academy Philippines also launched Community Classes in September, benefiting 7,000 students in its first month.

The said community classes will continue to be offered free of charge on top of courses from local and international creators, in hope of making a positive impact to the lives of Filipinos through education. (PR)"
Baguio mulls allowing entry of fully vaccinated tourists,"OCTOBER 20, 2021","BAGUIO CITY – The city government might open its borders to tourists and non-essential travelers as the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases here continue to drop.
